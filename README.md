Problem definition:
In the recent years, mental stability has proved proven to be major challenge among young people and also adults cutting across all genders. This has led to increase in number of suicide cases due to depression caused by either poverty, family drama, relationships and the current pandemic(Covid-19) which has seen many people losing their jobs and loved ones. Many of these people have a hard time opening up to people about what they are going through due to fear of being judged or being seen as a weak person.
